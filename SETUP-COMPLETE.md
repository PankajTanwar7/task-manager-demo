## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### 1. Create an Issue

Go to GitHub → Issues → New Issue → Use template

**Use the templates:**
- Feature Request (for new features)
- Bug Report (for bugs)

**Important:** Templates are clean - no @claude mentions!

### 2. Start Working

```bash
./scripts/start-work.sh <issue-number>
```

This:
- ✓ Fetches issue from GitHub
- ✓ Creates branch: `feature/<N>-description`
- ✓ Generates prompt file
- ✓ Shows you what to do next

### 3. Give Prompt to Claude Code

Paste the generated prompt to Claude Code (in terminal, not GitHub)

### 4. Claude Implements

I work locally:
- ✓ Read codebase
- ✓ Create/modify files
- ✓ Write tests
- ✓ Commit locally (not pushed yet)

### 5. Post to GitHub

```bash
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "What you requested" \
  "What was achieved"
```

This posts a formatted comment to the Issue.

### 6. Ready to Push?

I ask: "Ready to push and create PR?"

You approve: "Yes, proceed"

### 7. I Push & Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin feature/<N>-...
gh pr create ...
```

### 8. I Post to PR

```bash
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "What you requested" \
  "What was achieved"
```

This posts to BOTH Issue and PR.

### 9. You Merge on GitHub

- Review the PR
- Click "Squash and merge"
- ☑ CHECK "Delete branch"
- Confirm

### 10. Clean Up

```bash
./scripts/cleanup-after-merge.sh
```

This:
- ✓ Switches to main
- ✓ Pulls latest changes
- ✓ Deletes local feature branch
- ✓ Ready for next issue!
