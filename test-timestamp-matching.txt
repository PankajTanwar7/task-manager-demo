Timestamp-Based Prompt Matching Test
=====================================

This file exists to test that commits are matched to the correct prompt
based on timestamp proximity.

Test Scenario:
--------------
- prompt-history.json contains 3 prompts at different times
- This commit should match to the THIRD prompt (most recent one before commit)
- Previous algorithm would always show the last prompt
- New algorithm finds the closest prompt before commit time

Expected Result:
----------------
The auto-generated comment should show:
"Third test prompt: Create a simple test file to validate timestamp-based prompt matching works correctly"

NOT the other two prompts!

Test Status:
------------
- Commit 1: No prompts existed yet (showed default)
- Commit 2-3: Wrong dates - all prompts were on Nov 22, commits on Nov 21
  → Result: ❌ Fell back to tail -1 (showed wrong prompts)
- Commit 4: Fixed dates to Nov 21 (17:20, 17:40, 17:50, 18:30)
  → Expected: Should match to 17:50 prompt (third one)
  → Commit time: ~17:54 UTC
  → Should IGNORE 18:30 prompt (future)
  → Manual test: ✅ jq query returns correct prompt!
  → Now testing in real hook...
