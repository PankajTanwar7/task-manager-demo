Timestamp-Based Prompt Matching Test
=====================================

This file exists to test that commits are matched to the correct prompt
based on timestamp proximity.

Test Scenario:
--------------
- prompt-history.json contains 3 prompts at different times
- This commit should match to the THIRD prompt (most recent one before commit)
- Previous algorithm would always show the last prompt
- New algorithm finds the closest prompt before commit time

Expected Result:
----------------
The auto-generated comment should show:
"Third prompt: Create a simple test file to validate the system"

NOT the other two prompts!
