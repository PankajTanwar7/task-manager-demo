Timestamp-Based Prompt Matching Test
=====================================

This file exists to test that commits are matched to the correct prompt
based on timestamp proximity.

Test Scenario:
--------------
- prompt-history.json contains 3 prompts at different times
- This commit should match to the THIRD prompt (most recent one before commit)
- Previous algorithm would always show the last prompt
- New algorithm finds the closest prompt before commit time

Expected Result:
----------------
The auto-generated comment should show:
"Third test prompt: Create a simple test file to validate timestamp-based prompt matching works correctly"

NOT the other two prompts!

Test Status:
------------
- Commit 1: No prompts existed yet (showed default)
- Commit 2: Testing with 3 prompts at 12:20, 12:25, 12:30
  → Result: ✅ Matched to 12:30 prompt (third one) - CORRECT!
- Commit 3: Added 4th prompt at 14:00 (future timestamp)
  → Expected: Should STILL match to 12:30 prompt, NOT the 14:00 one
  → This proves timestamp matching works (not just tail -1)
